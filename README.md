Exploring Interpretable Machine Learning in Python
Objective: An exploration into using SHAP values when feature independence does not hold true.

Methodology: Using "Peeking into the Black Box" as the baseline:
- https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3595944
- https://github.com/actuarial-data-science/Tutorials/blob/master/8%20-%20Peeking%20into%20the%20Black%20Box/p02_descriptive.R

using Python instead of R
With the ultimate focus on SHAP on tree-based models (i.e. TreeSHAP rather than KernelSHAP), the glm and NN fits not covered further.
